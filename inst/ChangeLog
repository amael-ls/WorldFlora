	* New function WFO.url that creates urls for matched plant names, with an option to
	open a selection of urls in an HTML browser.

	* It is possible now to only match the Genus name.

	* New argument 'Fuzzy.force' to always use Fuzzy matching, even when an exact match
	was found for the spec.name.

	* New argument 'Fuzzy.max' to limit the number of fuzzy matches.

	* New argument 'Fuzzy.min' to limit the fuzzy matches to those with the smallest
	Levenshtein distance.

	characters, except the first character

	* New argument spec.name.nonumber that interpretes submitted names as unidentified
	species and seeks matches at generic level
