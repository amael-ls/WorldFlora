Version 1.3 (1 February 2020)

	* New function WFO.browse that shows all taxa at a next hierarchical level from the
	submitted and matched plant name (submitting a family results in a list of genera,
	a genus in a list of species and a species in a list of records at infraspecific
	levels). If no taxon is submitted, the function returns a list of all families.

	* New function WFO.synonyms that gives all taxa that have the same acceptedNameUsageID
	as the submitted and matched plant name.

	* New data.set 'vascular.families' that gives information about orders and major clades
	documented by the fourth update of the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group (APG IV,
	https://doi.org/10.1111/boj.12385). For gymnosperm and pteridophyte taxa, orders were
	obtained from http://www.mobot.org/MOBOT/research/APweb/. 

	* New function WFO.family that provides information from the 'vascular.families' for
	vascular families (angiosperms, gymnosperms and pteridophytes). For bryophytes, the 
	function returns 'bryophytes' based on an internal list of bryophyte families.

	* Modified WFO.match to handle the problem where authorities are not available for all
	submitted taxa (this caused a problem in WFO.one to select a unique best match).


Version 1.2 (4 January 2020)

	* New function WFO.one that results in a one-to-one match between the submitted
	plant names and the matched plant names. Where there were various candidates for a
	match, users can specify whether accepted names or names that are not synonyms are
	given priority. Where multiple candidates still exist, the matched name with the 
	smallest ID is selected.

	* Yet another priority is invoked for function WFO.one when the Authorship is given.
	In that case, first priority is given to records with the best match in Authorship.

	* The pattern ' x ' is now interpreted as marking of a hybrid plant name.

	* Sections in plant names that follow bracket '(' are now removed from the checked
	plant name, invoked by new argument 'Fuzzy.nobrackets' in WFO.match. This feature
	is expected to remove part of authorities that are not part of the names to be 
	matched (a match is searched in WFO column of 'scientificName', not 
	'scientificNameAuthorship').

	* New arguments of 'Fuzzy.two' and 'Fuzzy.one' in function WFO.match that limit names
	to be matched to respectively the first two or first terms of that name. These 
	options are expected to eliminate parts of names that are authorities, which are not
	part of names to be matched (see also argument 'Fuzzy.nobrackets').

	* New argument 'Authorship' for the WFO.match function that allows the user to
	specify the Authorship. The function will calculate the Levenshtein distance between
	the submitted and matched Authorships.

	* With a too large number of fuzzy matches, the message now gives one of the matched
	plant names, allowing the user to potentially verify the correctedness of a genus
	name.

	* The behaviour of 'spec.name.nonumber' now changed to limits searches to the first 
	term in case a submitted name contained any numbers (in the previous version, the
	behaviour was to searh for numbers at the end of submitted names).


Version 1.1 (15 December 2019)

	* New function WFO.url that creates urls for matched plant names, with an option to
	open a selection of urls in an HTML browser.

	* It is possible now to only match the Genus name.

	* New argument 'Fuzzy.force' to always use Fuzzy matching, even when an exact match
	was found for the spec.name.

	* New argument 'Fuzzy.max' to limit the number of fuzzy matches.

	* New argument 'Fuzzy.min' to limit the fuzzy matches to those with the smallest
	Levenshtein distance.

	* Output from function WFO.match gives the Levenshtein distance for fuzzy matches.

	* New argument spec.name.tolower that changes submitted species names to lower case
	characters, except the first character

	* New argument 'spec.name.nonumber' that interpretes submitted names as unidentified
	species and seeks matches at generic level

	* New argument 'exclude.infraspecific' that removes matched records with the specified
	infraspecific levels. Note that these matched records are removed both from matched 
	plant names (including synonyms) and matched accepted plant names (excluding 
	synonyms)

	* New argument spec.name.sub that removes sections in the submitted plant name


Version 1.0 (December 2019)

	* Package developed and submitted to CRAN
